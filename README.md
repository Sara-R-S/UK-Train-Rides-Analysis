# UK Train Rides

## Description
This project aims to analyze a dataset of UK train ticket purchases to gain insights into passenger behaviour, pricing trends, and operational efficiency. 

The dataset includes details such as ticket prices, purchase methods, railcard usage, journey times, and delay information. 

By exploring this data, we hope to identify patterns and trends that can inform decision-making related to pricing strategies, service improvements, and resource allocation within the UK rail network.
